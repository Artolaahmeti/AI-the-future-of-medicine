# AI-the-future-of-medicine
### Al and future of Medicine
“The future of standard medical treatment, in which a patient sees a computer before visiting a doctor, may be closer than we think. With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), it appears that the days of misdiagnosis and treating symptoms rather than the fundamental cause of disease may be numbered. “(Greenfield, 2019) Artificial Intelligence and access to "Big Data," along with emerging biotechnology advances, will fundamentally alter medical practice. Type II diabetes, for example, will no longer be considered a single condition. Many well-known diseases, such as liver or pancreatic cancer, will have hundreds of subtypes, each with its own treatment options. Clinicians will no longer be able to make diagnoses, remember disease names, medicine names, or management procedures without the assistance of computers. There will be a shift in the role of doctors as machine intelligence overtakes human intelligence in determining diagnosis and therapy. Machines cannot substitute clinical algorithms or human experience. It will take a long time to fully integrate or replace humans with machines. However, we must change our medical education system in order to adequately prepare the medical community and the general public for a peaceful transition. In 2016, more money was invested in healthcare AI initiatives than in any other sector of the global economy.  However, among the elation, there is also skepticism, with some advocating caution in the face of unrealistic expectations.  This examines current advancements in medical AI as well as the implications for general practice. According to Accenture Consulting, the artificial intelligence (AI) market in healthcare is estimated to reach $6.6 billion by 2021. From AI-based software for managing medical data to robotics helping surgeries, this revolutionary technology has paved the way for many breakthroughs. Despite the incredible progress, the sector is still in its infancy and is predicted to grow rapidly in the coming years, totally altering the business landscape.

## Providing healthcare assistance
Patient information is already in digital form, thanks to the rapid rise of wireless patient monitoring devices and wearable. Medical information is currently available on the internet for virtual assistants. Artificial intelligence-powered virtual assistants such as Siri, Cortana, Google Assistant, and Alexa are poised to become considerably more useful than simply hailing a cab. Researchers are currently focusing on using AI to power virtual assistants in order to improve medical word and clinical language recognition. This has the potential to revolutionize not only how healthcare professionals interact with EHRs, but also how patients comprehend their anatomy and constitution, become more engaged in the care process, and adhere to their drug regimens.

## What are Current Applications of AI in Medicine?

**Medical image analysis** In medical imaging, AI is already playing a significant role. According to studies, AI powered by artificial neural networks is just as good as human radiologists at detecting signs of breast cancer and other diseases. In addition to assisting physicians in recognizing early signs of sickness, AI can also assist in making the massive quantity of medical images that clinicians must maintain more manageable by detecting important aspects of a patient's history and presenting the relevant photos to them.

**AI using electronic medical records** Various attempts to construct AI systems employing EMRs are now underway. Furthermore, IBM has created Watson for Oncology, which gives cancer patients with appropriate customized therapy, and clinical studies are currently underway. 43 Selvas AI and Linewalks, both based in Korea, are pursuing comparable research.     

 **Diagnosis of the Disease** Diagnostics can be a lengthy and time-consuming process.Deep Learning algorithms have lately made significant progress in autonomously diagnosing diseases, reducing the cost and accessibility of tests. Machine Learning can be useful in the following scenarios: CT scans can be used to detect a brain tumor or lung cancer, ECG and cardiac MRI scans can be used to assess the risk of sudden cardiac arrest or other heart disorders, and identifying and classifying skin lesions in skin photos.   
 
**Accelerated drug development**
Drug development is a very costly procedure. Machine Learning can improve the efficiency of many of the analytical techniques used in drug development. This process goes through four stages starting from selecting intervention targets followed by discovering drug candidates, Speeding up clinical trials and finding Biomarkers for diagnosing the disease. 


**Personalize treatment** Not every patient has the same reaction to a certain therapy. As a result, tailored treatment has a huge potential to extend patients' lives. However, determining which characteristics should influence treatment selection is difficult. Machine Learning can assist determine which variables indicate that a patient will have a certain response to a given treatment by automating this complex statistical work. As a result, the algorithm can forecast a patient's likely response to a given treatment.

## Creating biased data and choosing a model

Artificially intelligent systems have their own set of restrictions and obstacles in any industry, including healthcare. With regard to the drawbacks of new technology, the moment has come to shift our perspective from reactive to proactive. We'll talk about those issues here, with a focus on those that are relevant to healthcare. AI systems then trained using a subset of the data collected, with the rest set aside for testing, if the data collected is biased, for example, if it targets a specific race, gender, or age group, the final model will be biased. Consequently, the information gathered must accurately reflect the demographic for which it is intended.Also choosing a model with so many algorithms and models to choose from, it's important to pick the one that's best suited to the task at hand. As a result, the model selection procedure is crucial. Models that are overly basic and fail to reflect the trends in a dataset are known as bias models.

## AI vs. Humans

AI is proving to be very accurate in diagnosing medical conditions. According in the searchers at a hospital in Oxford, England, have developed AI for predicting heart disease. Therefor, in 80% of the cases, the technology performed better than doctors in predicting cardiovascular diseases. Meanwhile, scientists at Harvard Medical School have developed a machine-learning-based microscope that can detect deadly blood infections with an astonishing 95% accuracy. (AI and the Future of Medicine). Patients must believe that consultations are being guided by human doctors since machines lack human traits such as empathy and sympathy. Furthermore, patients cannot be expected to trust AI right away, as it is a technology steeped in suspicion.  As a result, AI is frequently used to undertake activities that are necessary but restricted in scope, leaving the primary duty for patient treatment to a human doctor. A clinical research is currently underway to see if AI can compute target zones for head and neck radiation more precisely and faster than a person can. Although an interventional radiologist is still in charge of giving the therapy, AI plays a key role in shielding the patient from hazardous radiation.

## Conclusion
The application of artificial intelligence in clinical practice is a promising topic of research that is fast expanding alongside other modern sciences like precision medicine, genomics, and teleconsultation. While scientific advancement in generating new solutions to improve modern healthcare should continue to be rigorous and transparent, health policies should now focus on ethical and financial challenges linked with this cornerstone of medicine's evolution. Before AI can have an impact on healthcare practices, there are still obstacles to overcome.
